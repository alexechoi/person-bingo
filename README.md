# Person Bingo
This is a simple version of person bingo or human bingo that is designed to be able to be deployed on GitHub pages.

There is no complex setup or backend services required. If you wanted to deploy this on your own, clone or fork this repo and then all you would need to do to change the cards is to update the ```data.json``` file.
